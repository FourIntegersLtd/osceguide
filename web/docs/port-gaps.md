# Port gaps

Screens that came across from `frontend/` whose backend `platform-api` does not
serve yet, and the handful of places where the two systems disagree about a
shape. One file so the backlog is countable rather than scattered through
`TODO` comments nobody greps for.

Each entry says what the screen does today, so nothing is silently dropped.

## No endpoint on platform-api

| What | Where | Today |
|---|---|---|
| Landing statistics band | `domains/marketing/Numbers.tsx` | The retiring backend served `/api/v1/landing`. `fetchLandingStats` returns `null` without asking, and the band hides itself — asking would 404 on every view of the busiest public page. Putting it back is that function's body. |
| Achievements | not yet ported | The old consumer arm had `/achievements`. No backend. |
| Messages / contact | not yet ported | `/messages` in the old arm. No backend. |
| Product feedback form | `domains/marketing` section, unlisted | The "Help Us Improve" landing section is kept but left out of `landingSections`; it needs a product-feedback slice. |
| Push notifications | not ported | `web-push` is deliberately not a dependency here yet. |
| SSO configuration | not ported | `getSsoConfig` in the old arm. |
| Public user profiles | not ported | `/users/[userId]`. |
| Blog authoring | not ported | Reading is `capabilities/media`; authoring has no endpoint. |
| Exam wishes | not ported | `ExamWishes` in the old achievements folder. |
| Accessibility settings (extra reading time) | `foundation/ui/Timer.tsx` | The old client read `accessibility.needs_extra_reading_time` off the user and extended the clock from inside the timer. No such field on `platform-api`. The timer takes the duration it is given; when the field exists, whoever creates the attempt applies it. |
| Photo upload | `foundation/ui/PhotoUpload.tsx` | Posted to the old backend's `/api/upload_photos/{id}`. The component takes an `upload` function now, and nothing supplies one yet. |

## The one that blocks a whole screen

**Consumer performance analytics.** The four exam dashboards draw three things
from the retiring backend's `/api/{exam}_dashboard`: a pass/fail/critical
summary, a score per rubric domain, and a trend line over time.
`GET /api/v1/me/dashboard` serves none of them — it serves entitlements,
attempt counts, recent attempts and station sets, which is a real dashboard but
not that one.

The data exists. `assessment_results.payload` holds the engine's structured
output, keyed on the rubric's own domain and competency ids, and
`reviews/scoring.py` already turns a flat `domain.skill.score` map into a score
per domain — that is how an institution ranks a cohort. What is missing is the
step between: reading a framework's payload into that flat form. The
institution path never needed it, because its RAG comes from human reviews.

So the endpoint is buildable and contained — a `/me/performance` in the
`dashboard` slice, reading `attempts` and `rubrics` the way `service.py`
already reads `entitlements` and `station_sets` — but it needs a real marked
attempt to write against, not a guess at the payload's shape.

Until then the consumer dashboard shows what is true: progress, recent
attempts, sets and access.

## Shape disagreements

| What | Where | How it is handled |
|---|---|---|
| `user.user_id`, `user.station_progress` | `domains/marketing/InstallPrompt.tsx` | The old consumer user object inlined a progress array. The platform's `/me` carries neither — progress is its own endpoint. The prompt passes `user.id` and a count of 0, which errs towards showing onboarding once more rather than never. |

## Deliberately not ported

- `confetti-check`, a developer scratch page.
- `features/[featureId]`, superseded by the landing's feature sections.
- The four separate B2B console logins (`b2bLoginRoutes`), replaced by the one
  sign-in the platform actually has.
